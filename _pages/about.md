Welcome to my homepage! I am a Research Fellow at CSIRO, specializing in computer vision and artificial intelligence for real-world Challenges.

My work focuses on developing efficient and interpretable AI solutions for complex, low-data scenarios. I have contributed to multidisciplinary projects that span marine habitat mapping using sparse annotations, satellite-based atmospheric correction for climate monitoring, medical image segmentation for wound diagnosis, and visual understanding for autonomous navigation in unstructured environments.
I apply data-driven methods, combining machine learning, and tools like Power BI to analyze, visualize, and communicate insights from diverse datasets. With a strong research foundation and a drive for impact, I aim to bridge the gap between advanced AI methods and practical deployment in resource-constrained or high-stakes settings.

Prior to CSIRO, I completed my Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence, with a research focus on sparse representation, subspace learning, and optimization for visual recognition.
