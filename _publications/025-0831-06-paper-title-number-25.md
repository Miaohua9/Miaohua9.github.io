excerpt: 'Cross-domain few-shot learning is a challenging task that requires models to be able to generalize from a source domain to disjoint target domains with limited labeled data. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach called sample relationship learning (SRL) to enhance the model’s generalization ability. The SRL module consists of both a static and a dynamic components, which work together to enhance the model’s generalization ability. The static module is performed on the feature maps extracted from the backbone network to learn the sample relationship, which is effective for identifying similarities between samples. '
