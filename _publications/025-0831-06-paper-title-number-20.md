excerpt: 'Traditional tensor decomposition methods, e.g., two dimensional principle component analysis (2DPCA) and two dimensional singular value decomposition (2DSVD), minimize mean square errors (MSE) and are sensitive to outliers. In this paper, we propose a new robust tensor factorization method using maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) to improve the robustness of traditional tensor decomposition methods. A half-quadratic optimization algorithm is adopted to effectively optimize the correntropy objective function in an iterative manner. It can effectively improve the robustness of a tensor decomposition method to outliers without introducing any extra computational cost.'

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.
