permalink: /publication/2020-12-paper-title-number-4
excerpt: 'a mask-guided feature extraction and feature augmentation method is proposed in this paper to extract discriminative and informative regions of images which are then used to augment the original feature map. The advantage of the proposed method is that the feature detection and extraction model only requires a small amount of target region samples with bounding boxes for training, then it can automatically locate the target area for a large number of images in the dataset at a high detection accuracy.'

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.
