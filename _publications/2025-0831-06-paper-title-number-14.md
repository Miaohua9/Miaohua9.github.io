excerpt: 'this paper proposes a novel compositional feature embedding and similarity metric (CECS). Specifically, in the compositional feature embedding module, we randomly select patches in the original input image, and these patches are then replaced by patches from the images of different categories or masked out. Then the replaced and masked images are used to augment the original input images, which can provide more diverse samples and thus largely alleviate overfitting problem resulted from limited training samples.'

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.
