excerpt: 'Traditional matrix-based dimensional reduction methods, e.g., two-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA) and two-dimensional singular value decomposition (2DSVD), minimize mean square errors (MSE), which is sensitive to outliers. To overcome this problem, in this paper we propose a new robust 2DSVD method based on the kernel mean p power error loss (KMPE-2DSVD). Different from the MSE and the correntropy based ones which are second order statistics based measurements, the KMPE-2DSVD is based on the non-second order statistics in the kernel space, and thus is more flexible in controlling the representation error.

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.
