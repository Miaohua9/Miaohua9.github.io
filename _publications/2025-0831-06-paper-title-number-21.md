excerpt: 'Shape fitting, including straight line and ellipse fitting, plays an important role in the (cylinder-) shape control system of silicon single crystal growth, because the straight lines and ellipse in the crystal image contain the important horizontal circle center and diameter information. This information can be used as control variables so that the grown crystal approximates to a perfect cylinder, and thus can be used as high-quality source materials. In this paper, we develop new straight line and ellipse fitting algorithms.'
